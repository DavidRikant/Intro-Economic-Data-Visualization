# Intro Economic Data Visualization

## Goal of this Project

This being my first coding project, I gained a valuable understanding of implementing attention to detail and cohesive visualization techniques. The second file is the data used for conducting the visualization and analysis

## Summary

### Topic
The project focuses on comparing fuel consumption ratings of different car brands, aiming to analyze Canada's fuel efficiency performance metrics using R software.

### Introduction
The study explores whether technological advancements in automobile manufacturing have led to improved fuel economy. It investigates Canada's fuel efficiency data, emphasizing the significance of fuel consumption ratings in the used car market and the technological advancements by manufacturers to enhance efficiency.

### Data Description
Data sourced from the Government of Canada includes fuel consumption ratings and carbon dioxide emissions for various car makes and models. The analysis focuses on average combined consumption ratings for highway and city driving, using simplified variables for appropriate results.

### Summary Statistics
Summary statistics reveal insights into variables like engine size and fuel consumption. Notably, the average engine size is around 3.5L, and the average fuel consumption for all car makes is 11.02 L/100 km, contextualizing efficiency based on vehicle type.

### Visualizations
Plots depict trends in fuel consumption over time for selected cars and demonstrate normalized fuel consumption ratings across different car makes. These visualizations highlight variations in efficiency among manufacturers, with insights into luxury brands' performance and the impact of vehicle weight on fuel economy.

### Linear Regression Model
Linear regression analysis indicates the influence of years on fuel consumption ratings, with luxury brands exhibiting lower average ratings compared to American car companies. General trends suggest certain manufacturers produce more well-rounded cars with efficient fuel consumption.

### Conclusion
The analysis identifies Volkswagen and Toyota as consistently efficient car manufacturers, while American brands excel in lighter-weight vehicles but struggle with fuel efficiency in trucks and SUVs. Luxury brands strike a balance between performance and efficiency. The study also correlates the diversity of fuel consumption ratings with the overall production volume of car brands.
